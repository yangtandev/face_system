## 10. Autonomous Decision-Making Guidelines
- **User Instructions as Iron Law:** Never simplify, alter, or "interpret" user instructions to fit your habits. If an instruction says "Do not upload X", it means exactly that.
- **Respect .gitignore:** The .gitignore file is an absolute boundary. Never use `git add -f` to bypass it unless explicitly instructed by the user for a specific file.
- **Verification over Assumption:** Before committing, always verify `git status`. Do not assume your actions aligned with your intent.
